> The next generation Neos CMS interface written in ReactJS with Immutable data structures.

## Support the UI rewrite

We are currently raising funds to speed up the development. If you like what you see you can
support us by chipping in and help us to reach our goal. Find more details
[here](https://www.neos.io/blog/speeding-up-the-react-ui-development-with-your-support.html)

## Features

* Better editing experience for responsive websites.
* Faster load times for the backend.
* No reload constraint for the correct stylesheets on multi-site systems.
* Updated Font-Awesome to v4.5.0 (old icon names are migrated on the fly).


## Installation and usage

1. You need to have the latest release of Neos CMS (3.x) up & running.

2. Run the following command:
   ```
   composer require neos/neos-ui 1.0.*@beta neos/neos-ui-compiled 1.0.*@beta
   ```

3. Now you are all set up and can open the sub-route `/neos!` to login to the new interface.

### Updating

```
composer update neos/neos-ui neos/neos-ui-compiled
```

### Installing dev-master

For trying out the new UI, we recommend you to run the regularily released beta releases.
However, if you want to stay on bleeding-edge, or want to help out developing, you'll
need the `dev-master` release. You can install the master release using:

```
composer require neos/neos-ui:dev-master neos/neos-ui-compiled:dev-master
```

## Contributing

In order to start contributing, follow the following steps:

1) Ensure you have the `dev-master` version installed (see above).

2) We require [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#install-script) as well as the `npm` and `yarn`(`<sudo> npm install -g yarn`) command to be installed on your system.

   If you've installed `nvm` make sure that the next node LTS version `6.3.0` is correctly installed - You can do so by executing `nvm install v6.3.0`.
   If you need help setting up `nvm`, `npm`, `yarn` or if you got any other problems, join our [Slack](https://neos-project.slack.com/) channel and we are most happy to help you with it. :).__

3) Inside `Configuration/Settings.yaml`, set the following property for disabling the pre-compiled files:

   ```
   Neos:
     Neos:
       Ui:
         frontendDevelopmentMode: true
   ```

4) Run the initialization script:

   ```
   cd Packages/Application/Neos.Neos.Ui
   source Build/init.sh # do NodeJS stuff ie. install required node version using nvm, install npm deps, copy githooks
   yarn build # build everything using webpack (you might see some webpack warnings, but you can ignore them)
   ```

   Alternatively, you can also run the initialization by hand; which will mean:
   ```
   nvm install
   nvm use
   npm install -g yarn
   yarn

   npm run build:ui:watch
   ```

5) Get an overview about the codebase. We've recorded [an introduction on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYBUS5Nxxxk) which
   gets you acquainted with the basics. Additionally, please get in touch with us on [Slack](http://slack.neos.io) in the
   channel #project-ui-rewrite. We're eager to help you get started!

#### Development commands
| Command         | Description                    |
| --------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `yarn clear` | delete all node_modules in every subdirectory. |
| `yarn build:ui`  | Builds the ui via webpack. |
| `yarn build` |  Runs `build:dev` optimised for production. |
| `yarn build:ui:watch` | Watches the source files for changes and runs a build:ui in case. |
| `yarn build:ui:watch-poll` | Watches (and polls) the source files on a file share. Should preferably be used when working an a VM for example. |
| `yarn start-storybook` | Starts the storybook server on port 9001. |
| `yarn lint`  | Lints all source files. |
| `yarn test`  | Executes `yarn lint` to trigger tests via ava. |

#### Code style
Our code style is based upon `xo`, with one big difference - We use 4 spaces instead of tabs, to align our code style a bit with the PSR-2 standard for our PHP codebase. To lint the code, execute `yarn lint` in your shell.

#### Writing unit tests
The unit tests are executed with [jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/).
To run the unit tests, execute `yarn test` in your shell.

Adding unit tests is fairly simple, just create a file on the same tree level as your changed/new feature, named `[filename].spec.js` and karma will execute all tests found within the spec file, other than that, just orient yourself on the existing tests.

Use `it.only(() => {})` and `describe.only(() => {})` if you want to run a specific test and not the whole test suite.
